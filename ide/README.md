## Value-Changers structure

Each property has a corresponding value changer.

For example, a double might have a TextInputField, an alignment might have a 2D box with a pixel in it and a color
might have a color chooser.

In each value changer class there are two widgets, one which only manages the actual value change and
the other which also manager metadata.

Each value changer has a uniform signature to make it decoupled and easy to reuse.

- It takes in a value of its corresponding type
- It provides a ValueChanged callback with its corresponding type

Notes:
The widget must maintain its own state but also must accept values from the outside in didUpdateWidget.
