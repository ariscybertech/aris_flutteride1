# Flutter-IDE

An IDE for Flutter written in Flutter.

*Keep in mind, this is currently a prototype and a lot is going to change!*

### Stateful visual builder.

Work on the layout while keeping state.

### Drag and drop that produces quality code

Number one goal is not to replace coding layouts but enhance it.

### Building for different screens at the same time

Preview your live changes on as many different screen sizes as you want.

### Extensible and hackable

Don't want to use the Flutter-IDE but like the visual editor? Use the plugin!

Need new tools? Write a plugin for this IDE!

## What is already done?

- A lot of research and trial and error
- Server client communication (you can run the actual app on a phone for instance 
and change properties on your work machine)
- A working implementation of the interactive widget builder (though, I think
there might be a better solution)
