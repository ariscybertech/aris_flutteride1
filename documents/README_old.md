# A Flutter-IDE proposal

**Flutter is already super fast to develop with, but I have a vision that developing Apps of any kind can be even faster.**

Disclaimer: I won't go too deep into the technicalities in this very first draft. I just want to get the point across the table
and see if this, at its very core, makes sense. This might turn into an actual project if people are interested.

All of the following gifs are highly experimental and if this turns into an actual project, the UX will get improved 
drastically.

## How would Flutter as an IDE be possible to begin with

Flutter runs everywhere. 

Flutter Desktop is not finished yet and so isn't Hummingbird (Flutter Web) but a lot has happened in the last few months and a lot will happen this year.

Fun fact: [it could also run on a Raspberry-Pi](https://medium.com/flutter-io/flutter-on-raspberry-pi-mostly-from-scratch-2824c5e7dcb1).

## The advantages of using Flutter

Flutter is fun to build stuff in, but there is much more to it.

### Plugins for a Flutter based IDE would be written in Flutter (obviously)

**Why is this great?**

Flutter developers know Flutter. Meaning, the entry barrier to create a plugin is very low. 

In addition, because this is Flutter - creating intuitive and beautiful UI's for the plugin is easier
than ever before.

Both of these properties have the following result:
- Developers can quickly create a plugin for themselves before first learning something completely new.
- More plugins are being developed and the ecosystem can grow quickly.

### IDE can have runtime access to the App

Before taking a look at how this could be implemented, let's explore why this could potentially be a huge thing.

Runtime access means that the IDE not only has access to the source code, which is then compiled to machine
code but also the complete state/ variables while the app is running.

I've explored this idea under the name "Live-Reload". Hot-Reload is blazingly fast, but it still needs to
compile the code and upload the changes. Interactively changing, for example, the font size using a slider is not possible.

(https://github.com/Norbert515/flutter_experiment_phone_ide)

But because the IDE itself could have runtime access to the underlying code, all it would have to do is modify a variable
and schedule a rebuild. 

A few ideas how Live-Reload could be used:
- Changing basic values for rendering (width/height/color/font-size etc.) with a slider/color-picker
- Controlling/ Debugging an animation (even a hero animation) using a slider inside the IDE
- Injecting data into Streams during runtime for testing and debugging purposes
- Changing  values in a visual editor (which are reflected in the source code)

#### How this could be implemented

##### Multiple Flutter instances running through one engine
Flutter Desktop is currently being developed and one tricky bit is supporting multiple Windows in one Flutter App.
Without going into the details, splitting up the way code is run versus how it is displayed would possibly allow having multiple Flutter instances running which are accessing the same code.

##### As showcased in my experiments
It could also utilize the hot-reload and source code manipulation which I used for the prototype.

#### Isn't IntelliJ already doing this?
Yes and no. IntelliJ has a way to communicate with the runtime, but they are pretty restricted and hard to set up.
It is possible to send messages to the dart VM which then gets passed to Flutter through the Flutter-engine. 

### Interactive rendering

Because the IDE is Flutter, widgets from the app can be rendered inside the IDE.

#### Working on isolated widgets

Instead of first creating a page and putting the widget in there. You could select the widget in code and open
a widget-renderer. Then, while changing the code, you can hot reload that single widget, or make it so it reloads
automatically.

This could especially be useful for widgets which take in data, which you'd first have to mock out. In the IDE you could
provide the data to use and even change it (using Live-Reload). Think about a text card where you want to fine tune
the behavior using different text lengths.

#### iOS like Storyboards

**A visual overview over the pages in the app and their connections.**

Again, Flutter can render the pages (they are only widgets). 

What needs to be done is:

#### Figuring out the connections between the pages

The problem is, that routes can be pushed from anywhere and in a lot of possible ways.

Creating a well-structured way of pushing page routes which makes it easy to understand for a computer would 
probably be the easiest solution.

#### Figuring out how to render a page

The problem is, that pages can depend on all sorts of data. Data can either be passed to the page, the page can
depend on an `InheritedWidget` or it could even depend on some static/ global variables.

There are a couple of ways to solve this problem. But again, having a well-structured page class which handles
default parameters (for rendering in the IDE), would probably be the easiest solution.

## Layout-Editor

When switching into layout mode, the current page could display all slots where widgets could be dropped into. 
For example, a `Column` would expose a slot at the top of the first widget and beneath the last widget. A scaffold could expose the 
FAB slot and so on.

Then all default widgets and custom widgets would be displayed in a list, ready to drag in. 
When this happens, the source code is changed.

## Plugin ideas

Just a few ideas I thought I'd drop into (before I forget them myself).

### JSON-Dart manager
Copy a JSON schema into the plugin. Instead of just converting the JSON to a Dart Object, it keeps the JSON
representation. You can then toggle between Dart-object/JSON representation to make adjustments. Both are always in sync.

### Curve-Adjustments 
Like https://googlesamples.github.io/web-fundamentals/fundamentals/design-and-ux/animations/curve-playground.html
but inside Flutter.

### Local-Database viewer/ manipulator/ manager

## Writing the IDE

One of the biggest downsides to this project is, that most stuff will need to be done from scratch.
There is no fully implemented file system manager or code editor. 

But on the other hand, this could also be a chance to make it fit very well with
the Flutter ecosystem.

Flutter is fast. Not only in terms of execution but also in development. Even though this is a gigantic project
I have no doubt that there can be useful features finished in a reasonable amount of time.

For example having a Flutter-IDE app called Widget Maker, which interactively helps to build widgets.

## Discussion

These are just a bunch of ideas written down and I'd love to have a discussion on this.
